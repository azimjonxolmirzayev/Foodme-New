  "faqtext2": "I already have paper menus, why is your digital menu better?",
  "faqtext3": "Our digital QR code menu is contactless and always 'on the table'. Guests don't have to wait for a waiter to bring them a menu or search for a menu on their own. The lower the waiting time and actions to fulfill the order, the more orders will be placed.",
  "faqtext4": "I have a QR code menu with a PDF file, how is your digital menu different?",
  "faqtext5": "The PDF file is not interactive. It inherits all the shortcomings of the paper menu. Your QR code menu doesn't look like a modern store page designed to increase your sales, but rather a text-based price list.",
  "faqtext6": "You can't add photos and descriptions for each item in the PDF menu, it will immediately become large and unreadable.",
  "faqtext7": "When you scan the QR code of the PDF menu, you need to download it to your phone, which can be problematic if you have a slow internet connection or if your guests don't like downloading things to their phones.",
  "faqtext8": "Once again, PDF menus cannot be quickly edited. Now you need to restore the entire PDF and upload it back to your hosting. In our digital menu, a similar operation takes 20 seconds, and even with Android or iPhone",
  "faqtext9": "Do I have to call or text you every time I want to change something in the QR code menu?",
  "faqtext10": "No, you don't have to. You can edit the QR code menu at any time. We've developed an admin interface that makes it easy to edit your menu from desktop and mobile devices.",
  "faqtext11": "We can also give your employees access to your digital menu so that they can access it without any effort from you",
  "faqtext12": "Where can I see what your QR code menu looks like?",

  "faqtext14": "You can also check out the admin menu design and try it for free here",
  "faqtext15": "Is it possible to try your digital menu for free first?",

  "faqtext17": "I want to change the name of a restaurant, cafe or bar, but I don't want to print new QR codes for the menu, what should I do?",
